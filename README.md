# Process Schedular Emulator

A program which emulates the process scheduler in operating systems.
So far the program is entirelty in C++.

**If running**: download *inputProcesses.txt* to the same directory as the executable.

Features currently part of the program:
- FSFC or FIFO scheduling
- Enquiry of which process was running at a certain time

Features to be added to the program:
- SJF scheduling
- SRemainingJF sceduling
- Export process execution timeline as a graph

The forthcoming plan is to spend one final session on this project:
- Upgrade version to 1.1
- Implement SJF
- Implement SRJF
